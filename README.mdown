# This is not the MessagePack gem you are looking for

This project has been merged into the [msgpack-ruby project](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-ruby) and is now a part of the [msgpack gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/msgpack).

The msgpack-jruby gem will no longer be updated, all future development will go into the msgpack-ruby project to develop and maintain a single MessagePack library for all rubies.

# MessagePack for JRuby

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iconara/msgpack-jruby.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iconara/msgpack-jruby)

A MessagePack implementation for JRuby, built on top of the MessagePack Java libraries. Faster and easier to use than using the C MessagePack gem in JRuby.

## Installation

    gem install msgpack-jruby

or with Bundler

    gem 'msgpack-jruby', :require => 'msgpack'

## Extra features

* Decode keys as symbols by passing `:symbolize_keys => true` to `#unpack`.
* Decode strings with their right encoding by passing `:encoding => Encoding::UTF_8` to `#unpack`.
